# cycle-coalescence-algorithm
##  Introduction

  ./notebook contains examples to play with in the form of jupyter notebooks
##  Installation
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps cycle_analysis
##  Usage

```python
import networkx as nx
import cycle_analysis.cycle_coalescence as cc
import cycle_analysis.test as cat

# generate a dummy graph for testing
# put an edge weight distribution on the system, available are random/gradient/bigradient/nested_square
G=nx.grid_graph((7,7,1))
G=cat.generate_pattern(G,'nested_square')

# merge all shortest cycles and calc the merging tree's asymmetry
asymmetry=cc.calc_cycle_asymmetry(G)
print(asymmetry)
```

##  Requirements
``` networkx ```, ``` numpy ```

This implementation is based on the cycle coalescence algorithm as described by Modes et al, 2016.
